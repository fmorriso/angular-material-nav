# angular-material-nav

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

It uses Angular Material and very little SCSS (mostly colors) because the whole point of using a canned set of SCSS/CSS such as Angular Material or Bootstrap is to avoid getting "tangled in the weeds" of SCSS/CSS.

Upgraded to [Angular 7.x](https://angular.io/) and [Angular Material 7.x](https://material.angular.io/components/categories) on February 14, 2019.

## Purpose

To figure out how to create a horizontal navigation bar using Angular Material because the available documentation is poor, non-existent and/or located in a part of the Angular Material documentation that you would not expect.
