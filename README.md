# angular-material-nav

This project was created so I could research how to render a **_horizontal_** navigation bar for use with routing in Angular using Angular Material components.

I had previously figured out how to do this using Angular plus [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

The biggest obstacle I faced was that all the examples of navigation in Angular Material with **_vertially oriented_**, sidebar navigation (fixed or fly out).  I could not find a single example on the Angular Material website on how to create a **_horizontal_** navigation bar.

Software used in this project:
* [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).
* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/components/categories)
* SCSS (mostly colors) because the whole point of using a canned set of SCSS/CSS such as Angular   Material or Bootstrap is to avoid getting "tangled in the weeds" of SCSS/CSS.
